ScopeIO  
=======

It's tool to be embedded on a device that helps to understand what is happening inside
when simulation tools are not enough to guess what is wrong with the design.

How it was born
---------------

I found myself in a situation in which I had to debug a high-performance open
source portable DDR Core. I needed to capture a lot of data to know what was
happening and displayed it

Goals 
-----

- Small footprint to be embedded
- Portability
- Video interface to display data
- Block RAM requirement only
- Multiple communication system to dump and upload data
