ScopeIO  
=======

It's tool to be embedded along with a design that helps to understand what is happening inside
when simulation tools are not enough to guess where the bug is.

Goals 
-----

- Small footprint to be embedded
- Portability
- Video interface to display captured data
- Block RAM requirement only
- Data transfer **to** and **from** the system
